			<p>Understanding how Muslim majority countries operate is complex. But to understand terrorism, you need to understand each backbone of it: how politics and religion intertwine and their reasons for doing so. Below are three key topics that will give you some insight into why Muslim majority countries operate the way that they do and why terrorist organizations exist.</p>
          <strong>Struggle for Islamic Reform Between Modern and Conservative Religious Groups</strong>
<p>There has been a long debate about whether or not traditional and outdated practices of Islam have contributed to failed democracies in Muslim majority countries and the debate goes on about whether or not Islam needs reform. Islamic practices such as Sharia Law, the status of women, terrorism and treatment of non-muslims all contribute to the how the government in Muslim majority countries operate. There are two important reformist groups who have been at the center of this debate since it started – the Ulama and the Modernists. The Ulama, who first came around in the era after Prophet Muhammad’s death, are a conservative, anti-Western, traditional Islamist group who believe in legal reform and historic Islamic practices. The Ulama is aware that Islam needs some sort of reform, yet they aren’t open to change because they fear the incorporation of Western thought. This mindset makes it impossible to find common ground with the Modernists, who are well educated (most educated in the West at top universities like Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc.) and believe that Islam needs reform with Western ideas and progressive leadership. The modernists are so open to incorporating Western ideals and customs into Islam, that they are seen as insensitive to traditional ideas that conservative groups such as the Ulama believe in. Because both groups have strong, differing opinions about how Islam should be reformed, the full effects of democratization have yet to experienced in Muslim majority countries. It’s important to remember that democracy in these countries struggles not because of Islam itself, but because of the differing beliefs of those who govern and actively take part in the politics of Islamic countries.</p>
<strong>Global Terrorism</strong>
<p>Organizations like ISIS and Al-Qaeda originated in Muslim majority countries. These terror organizations only want one thing: power. This power is what they see as an “Islamic State”. They seek transcontinental authority and will kill/behead anyone who doesn’t agree with their Wahhabi idea of Islam. ISIS offers an extremist, militant and radical view of Wahhabi Islam to justify their barbaric notions. Their ideas totally violate Islamic Law, yet they portray themselves as “religious” in order to gain a supporting base. ISIS and Al-Qaeda oppose democratic forms of government, spew notions of Western hatred and distort teachings in the Qur’an for their political agendas. ISIS, or Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, was created in 2003 after Bush invaded Iraq. The group expanded because of political conditions, and the result of expansion has been the creation of ethnic and religious warfare as well as increased hostility in Syria. Failure from the U.S. and other Western countries to respond to the actions of these terror groups, and their oppressive governments such as the Assad regime, in a right and timely manner has only given these terrorist groups power. <br><br>
Al-Qaeda, once a U.S. Government trained group known as “The Freedom Fighters”, was created to successfully help the United States push Russia out of Afghanistan. Osama Bin Laden and the rest of the freedom fighters later turned against the U.S. In order to gain a following, they used religion as a political tool. Al-Qaeda exploited the term ‘Jihad’ in the Qur’an. Jihad, which means to strive and struggle (I.e. continue to be a better student, wife, person, human, etc. even when in the face of adversity), was blown out of context and Al-Qaeda started using the term as a justification for a holy war. This theology of hatred started to divide Muslims in countries such as Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. As a result, many Muslims faced harsh backlash if they weren’t followers of Osama Bin Laden. This false idea of “Jihad” has been the backbone of ideas in Saudi Arabia, and still continues to be taught in schools and lectures throughout rural regions of Muslim majority countries.</p>
<strong>Lack of Education and the Start of Arab Spring</strong>
<p>Lack of education in rural areas still exist today. The distorted teachings of Islam and the term Jihad divide Muslims and train the next generation to think radically, violently and militantly, thus lessening the chance for a true, working democracy in Muslim majority countries. In 2011, Muslims throughout the Middle East, Asia and Africa started to become aware of these false, Wahabi notions and it led to an “awakening” across Muslim majority countries. In the end however, the awakening did more harm than good. The movement divided Muslims more than before. The “Spring (or Arab) Awakening made its first rounds in Libya, Tunisia, Egypt and Syria. The Spring Awakening is one of the main causes for the uprising in Syria today. This politically driven event was yet again intertwined with religion and it divided the Sunnis and Shiites -- forcing them against each other due to the support/lack of support for the Assad regime. This division rooted in religion started an influx of opposition Sunni and Jihadist groups that infiltrated not just Syria, but other regions in South Asia and the Middle East. As per usual in Islamic countries, religion got the best of politics and the Arab spring led to the most growth ISIS has ever had, giving these terror organizations power and most of all expansion. <br><br>  
The politics of Muslim majority countries are complex, but it’s clear to see that the issues of terrorism have less to do with Islam and more with opposition/terror groups using the religion as a political tool. </p>
