	<h5>Muhammad's Revelations</h5>
<li>Muhammad often retreated to “the cave of Hira” to contemplate, reflect and think about the corruption of society and how much he wanted to stop it. The cave overlooked Mecca</li><br>
<li>After going to the cave for 15 years, Muhammad received his revelation and was called on to be the prophet of Islam 
This happened during the now month of Ramadan – hence why Ramadan is such a holy month</li><br>
<li>Ramadan is the 9th month of the lunar calendar year,
Muhammad was revealed two verses from the Qur’an</li><br>
<li>Islam is all about knowledge + learning.
When Muhammad first received the revelations he was scared, overwhelmed and hesitant</li><br>
<li>Muhammad called for:
Social justice for the poor, oppressed (women, etc) and the lonely and took active action against corruption</li><br>
<li>He rejected Arabian Polytheism</li> <br>
<li>Muhammad advocated for the notion of Tawhid, that is, the “oneness” of God. The belief that there is one god “Allah”.
	Islam is centered around the notion of Tawhid, personal accountability and responsibleness</li><br>
<li>The first believers in him were Khadija, Ali and Abu Bakr
Khadija died of starvation. Meccan officials didn’t believe in Muhammad's divine right to lead Islam and they plotted to kill him, however before the Meccans could kill him he fled to Medina. Government officials in Medina had offered Muhammad the chance to be the head of state for Media as well as the prophet of Islam</li><br>
			
<li>This year, the year 622, the year that Muhammad flees to Medina is known as Hijra</li><br>
			
<li>The year 622 or “Year or Hijra” is the start of the Islamic calendar. It’s important because it emphasized the importance of community in Islam</li>
