			<strong>Overview of Life</strong>
          <ul><li>Muhammad's dad Abdullah died before he was born – his uncle raised him</li><br>
<li>When Muhammad was growing up, he traveled to different areas (I.e. Palestine, Syria, etc). With his uncle. This gave him nuanced perspectives and he eventually met Khadija
Khadija was far older than Muhammad (20 years-ish), she was wealthy, and she actually asked him to marry her 
Khadija remained Muhammad's only wife until she died. Khadija died of starvation. Meccan society didn’t believe in Muhammad's divine right to lead Islam  – they tried to kill him</li><br>
<li>Muhammad's nickname was al-amin, which means “the honest one”. Muhammad was known for his integrity and morally/ethically correct character. He was compassionate too.</li><br>
<li>After the death of Khadija, Muhammad went on to marry multiple wives, however,
Muhammad married a number of women who had lost their husbands in the war fighting for Muhammad and Islam
Again, this proves how compassionate and tolerant Muhammad was</li><br>
<li>Polygamy was allowed back in the day in the Qur’an, but today it is heavily discouraged. The Qur’an suggests that you shouldn’t marry more than one woman unless you can love them equally – which you can’t</li></ul>
