			<strong>Overview of Life</strong>
          <ul><li>Muhammad's dad Abdullah died before he was born – his uncle raised him</li>
<li>When Muhammad was growing up, he traveled to different areas (I.e. Palestine, Syria, etc). With his uncle. This gave him nuanced perspectives and he eventually met Khadija
Khadija was far older than Muhammad (20 years-ish), she was wealthy, and she actually asked him to marry her 
Khadija remained Muhammad's only wife until she died. Khadija died of starvation. Meccan society didn’t believe in Muhammad's divine right to lead Islam  – they tried to kill him</li>
<li>Muhammad's nickname was al-amin, which means “the honest one”. Muhammad was known for his integrity and morally/ethically correct character. He was compassionate too.</li>
<li>After the death of Khadija, Muhammad went on to marry multiple wives, however,
Muhammad married a number of women who had lost their husbands in the war fighting for Muhammad and Islam
Again, this proves how compassionate and tolerant Muhammad was</li>
<li>Polygamy was allowed back in the day in the Qur’an, but today it is heavily discouraged. The Qur’an suggests that you shouldn’t marry more than one woman unless you can love them equally – which you can’t</li>
<li>Muhammad often retreated to “the cave of Hira” to contemplate, reflect and think about the corruption of society and how much he wanted to stop it. The cave overlooked Mecca</li>
<li>After going to the cave for 15 years, Muhammad received his revelation and was called on to be the prophet of Islam 
This happened during the now month of Ramadan – hence why Ramadan is such a holy month</li>
<li>Ramadan is the 9th month of the lunar calendar year,
Muhammad was revealed two verses from the Qur’an (p.96)</li>
<li>Islam is all about knowledge + learning.
When Muhammad first received the revelations he was scared, overwhelmed and hesitant</li>
<li>Muhammad called for:
Social justice for the poor, oppressed (women, etc) and the lonely and took active action against corruption</li>
<li>He rejected Arabian Polytheism</li> 
<li>Muhammad advocated for the notion of Tawhid, that is, the “oneness” of God. The belief that there is one god “Allah”.
	Islam is centered around the notion of Tawhid, personal accountability and responsibleness</li>
<li>The first believers in him were Khadija, Ali and Abu Bakr
Khadija died of starvation. Meccan officials didn’t believe in Muhammad's divine right to lead Islam and they plotted to kill him, however before the Meccans could kill him he fled to Medina. Government officials in Medina had offered Muhammad the chance to be the head of state for Media as well as the prophet of Islam</li>
<li>This year, the year 622, the year that Muhammad flees to Medina is known as Hijra</li>
<li>The year 622 or “Year or Hijra” is the start of the Islamic calendar. It’s important because it emphasized the importance of community in Islam</li>
<li>In addition to being the Prophet of Islam in Medina, Muhammad was also the Head of State. In this role he had to regulate multi-religions. Consequently, Muhammad wrote “The Chart of Media” AKA laws that were established in Medina to unite all faiths. Muhammad recognized that “people of the book” jews, christians and all other religions had the right to practice their own religion freely without consequence</li>
<li>At first, the Meccans did not like the Prophets message and rejected it so much that they were planning to kill Muhammad</li>
<li>Even after Muhammad fled to Medina, Mecca still faced violent turbulence. Meccans were constantly attacking Muslims in Medina, yet despite this, the Muslims never started a fight first</li> 
<li>This yet again highlights how much of a peaceful religion Islam is</li>
<li>630 was the last battle and the Meccans FINALLY surrendered. Muhammad came to Kaaba, Mecca</li>
<li>While he was there, he gave amnesty to ALL Meccans 
Yet again, Muhammad proved to be diplomatic, compassionate and forgiving</li>
<li>After this event many Meccans joined Islam & became apart of the Muslim community</li>
<li>The war between Mecca and Medina was finally over – united over Islam</li>
<li>Muhammad eventually died in 632</li>
</ul>
